# Davinci-Scripts
I made these bash scripts to work around the lack of AAC encoding in Davinci Resolve on Linux.

This will allow a user to batch convert videos 

These require ffmpeg to be installed.

## mp42mov.sh

Converts all mp4 files in a directory to mov files and puts originals in an original directory.

## webm2mov.sh

## flacConvert.sh

Pulls audio from a file and converts to flac.
